jGen - JavaScript Game Engine
====

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

I've decided to restart this project, old code now is available in the "first-try" branch. All new code will be published in the master branch.
Follow the updates!

**INTRODUCTION**

It's Just an attempt to recreate "old school" isometric techniques in the modern web browsers without using a canvas, with only JavaScript and HTML.
Don't expect to see something amazing while checking the demos. Project is very young and my attention at this moment is concentrated on getting map editor tool done. However the engine itself (checkout tanks game demo) currently supports simple sprite animation, collisions, rendering an isometric map. *At this moment works only in Chrome and Safari*. If you are interested in this project, please contact me. I'm looking for contributors.

**LOOKING FOR PARTICIPANTS:**

Our project is very young, and we're looking for people who's interested in game development as well as cutting edge web technologies. So if you feel like you can contribute, please let me know. You are not necessary have to be a developer, we need any help, such as graphic design / testing / bringing new ideas / promoting us / writing articles and etc.

**FOR THE DEVELOPERS:**

You can find classes overview as well as examples in our wiki, just follow the structure on the left side of the page (in the sidebar): http://code.google.com/p/jgen/wiki/Overview?tm=6

**ONLINE DEMOS:**

* Current state of the trunk (api-test):
  * [Collisions - Demo](http://angrycoding.github.io/jgen/api-test/)
  * [2D Map with sprite animation - Demo](http://angrycoding.github.io/jgen/api-test/map.html)
  * [Sprite Animation - Demo](http://angrycoding.github.io/jgen/api-test/sprite-animation.html)
* [Tanks game online demo](http://angrycoding.github.io/jgen/tanks/)

**For all demos, use the arrow keys to control the game scene.**

* [Map editor online demo](http://angrycoding.github.io/jgen/map-editor/)

**IMPORTANT! KNOWN ISSUES:**

* Editor and demos supported only by Safari and Chrome.* Future plans is to extend it on Firefox.
* Because of the restrictions in Google Chrome (XMLHttpRequest object is not able to read local files), you might need to upload editor or game demos on your local server in order to see it. However it works perfectly in Safari.
